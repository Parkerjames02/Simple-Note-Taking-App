## 📝 Simple Note Taking App
As the name implies this is a simple note taking app that I made in Java with a command line interface. It allows the user to
login as a user (the only user information is my own) or login a guest and enter their own personal information before
presenting the user with the option of creating new notes, editing or appending old notes, view previous notes, or exiting the
application.
## ✨ Technologies
- Java
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- User input
## 🚀 Features
- Login (little functionality)
- Create new notes
- Edit previous notes
- View previous notes
## 📌 The Reason
I made this simple note taking application for my Java II class final project to showcase what I had learned about Java during
the length of the class. The main goals for this application was to show off my knowledge of classes, inheritance,
polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, file input and output processing, recursion, and exception handling.
## 📖 How To Use
Upon running the application the user has the option of logging in as a registered user or as a guest. It should be noted that
registered users and guest users expereince the application in the exact same way so there is no difference in the experience
between the two options. Once the user has logged in they have the option of creating new notes, adding on to previous notes,
viewing notes, or exiting the application by entering numbers 1-4. Creating new notes will remove the previous notes that were
being stored and start a new notes page. The user can then put in their first note on the notepad. Once the user has entered in
their first new note they will be taken back to the menu where they can choose to once again create new notes, edit notes, view
notes, or exit the application. When you select the edit note option it allows the user to input one note at a time. Once the
user adds the first new note the application will ask the user if they would like to add another line to the note. Finally,
selecting view notes just displays the current notes that the user has saved. Once the user is done creating, editing, and 
viewing notes they can select option four to close down the application.
