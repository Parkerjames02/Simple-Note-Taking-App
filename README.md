## 📝 Simple Note Taking App
As the name implies this is a simple note taking app that I made in Java with a command line interface. It allows the user to
login as a user (the only user information is my own) or login a guest and enter their own personal information before
presenting the user with the option of creating new notes, editing or appending old notes, view previous notes, or exiting the
application.
## ✨ Technologies
- Java
- CLI (Command Line Interface)
- User input
## 🚀 Features
- Login (little functionality)
- Create new notes
- Edit previous notes
- View previous notes
## 📌 The Reason
I made this simple note taking application for my Java II class final project to showcase what I had learned about Java during the length of the class. The main goals for this application was to show off my knowledge of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, file input and output processing, recursion, and exception handling.
