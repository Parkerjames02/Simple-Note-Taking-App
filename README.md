## 📝 Simple Note Taking App
As the name implies this is a simple note taking app that I made in Java with a command line interface. It allows the user to
login as a user (the only user information is my own) or login a guest and enter their own personal information before
presenting the user with the option of creating new notes, editing or appending old notes, view previous notes, or exiting the
application.
